What is OpenSCHC ?
==================

OpenSCHC
--------

OpenSCHC is a OpenSource Implementation of `SCHC (Static Context Header Compression) <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc/>`_ currently being standardized by the `LPWAN Working Group <https://tools.ietf.org/wg/lpwan/>`_ at the IETF. Oversimplifying, this is essentially IPv6 compression and fragmentation intended for low datarate, long range IoT networks.

The short/medium term goal is to organize SCHC Hackathons that occur at the IETF meetings.

The long term wish is to have a stable, open-source, reference codebase for the SCHC protocol (in Python)

OpenSCHC is developed to work with micropython.
